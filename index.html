      <h1 id="article-title">Resin Starter Kit</h1>
      <p>Resin art is extremely fun but can seem overwhelming initially with the amount of products available. Here's a quick suggestive guide for starting up your new resin hobby! </p>

      <section>
        <h2 id="supplies-title">Resin Supplies</h2>
        <p>When you're starting off with resin art, you will definitely want to purchase a variety of supplies. You will be needing mixing supplies, cleaning supplies and decorative supplies.</p>

        <section>
          <h3 class="supply-type">Mixing/Cleaning Supplies</h3>
          <p>It's essential to ensure <strong>safety</strong> abover anything else when working with resin as it is a strong substance.  Here are some items to help you make sure you keep yourself and your work environment safe.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rubber Gloves</li>
            <li>Plastic Cups</li>
            <li>Wooden Craft Sticks (for mixing)</li>
            <li>Safety Mask (to prevent breathing in resin fumes)</li>
            <li>99% Rubbing Alcohol (for quick clean up of spilled resin)</li>
            <li>Baby Wipes or Paper Towels</li>
            <li>Mats (to cover workspace and prevent mess)</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3 class="supply-type">Decorative Supplies</h3>
          <p>Depending on what you are using resin for, you will want to purchase some other art supplies and mediums to use the resin with. This is only a starter guide so feel free to experiment with other things!</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4 class="decor">Canvas Art</h4>
              <p>You can use resin to make beautiful works of art on canvases very easily.  Resin can be mixed with acrylic or oil paint, alcohol inks or glitter and then poured onto a canvas.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4 class ="decor">Resin Pieces</h4>
              <p>Resin can also be used to make pendants or keychains. To make items like these, you will additionally need to purchase molds to pour the resin into. Some plastic molds work well with resin but silicone molds work the best as hardener resin does not stick to silicone and can be easily popped out. You can find tons of silicone molds on eBay, Aliexpress and Etsy. Similarily as with canvas art, you can mix the resin with paint alcohol inks or glitter! You can also try adding in small beads or pressed flowers into the resin.</p>

          </ul>
